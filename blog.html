          <ul class="questions">
            <li>What excites you about coding? How do you think it can change the world?</li>
            <ul><li>Coding challanges me not only in terms of problem solving, but also in terms of the bounds of creativity and provides me with an opportunity in learning different ways of approaching problems. Coding can change the world by creating solutions for problems and can make people's lives easier.</li></ul>
            <li>What does doctype do at the top of your html file do? Why does this need to be specified?</li>
            <ul><li>"doctype" specifies the type of language you will be typing in that particular page, allowing the computer to compile it appropriately.</li></ul>
            <li>Explain how a browser determines what HTML Elements match a CSS selector.</li>
            <ul><li>The browser reads from right to left, from the most specific aspect being the rightmost, and losing its specificity as the selector length decreases in size.</li></ul>
            <li>What's the difference between and HTML Element and and HTML Tag?</li>
            <ul><li>HTML tags are used to enclose information about the type of information you are inputting between the opening and closing tabs. An Element is used to refer to the totality of code included between two HTML tags, as well as the tags themselves.</li></ul>
            <li>In your own words, explain the Cascade of CSS?</li>
            <ul><li>Cascading refers to the way the CSS styling is read, which is from top to bottom, with the most recently read line taking precedence in terms of styling applied.</li></ul>
