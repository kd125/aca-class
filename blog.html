        <p class="questions">The aspect of coding that excites me the most is its ability to be mentally challenging. There is an aspect of constant learning associated with coding, whether it be to solve a particular problem you are working on or simply staying up to date with the different languages. There is also an aspect of constant evolution associated with coding/languages; ideas/rules that may have been valid 10, or even 5 years ago can become dated with the evolution of the languages, with better/more efficient alternatives being introduced. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Coding also has as aspect of constantly challenging one’s creativity. As I learn more about the different aspects of HTML/CSS, I realize there are infinite possibilities of what one can achieve, and challenges me to think outside the box of the fixed ideas I produce in my mind. There is an aspect of there being “no right answers” with coding, one can choose to approach a problem in multiple different ways and still arrive at the same solution. As I further my knowledge with different languages, I can only imagine the possibilities of what I can create. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Another aspect of coding that excites me is its versatility. One can learn certain languages and then build upon those languages with other languages, which then open up the possibility to work in many different sectors. If someone is a more creative minded person, they can choose to focus on the front-end aspects of web development, or choose to work in game development, while a more logical minded person may choose to work with AI, etc.

        <p class="questions">Selectors are utilized in CSS to apply certain styling characteristics to specific elements. Selectors can be as broad as the whole document, or as specific as one line, or one word within the document. Pseudo Selectors are used in CSS to apply certain styling characteristics to elements in specific states.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of the most common pseudo classes that we come across is “:hover”. It is used to modify how a certain element will look if a user were to move their cursor over it. We can see examples of this in certain sites when we move our cursor over a specific paragraph or line of text, that paragraph or line of text may change color, or its font size may become larger, and then it will return to normal once the cursor has been removed from it. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Another pseudo selector that we come across often is the “:required” selector. It highlights/warns the user when a required input field/checkbox has not been selected by the user. We most frequently encounter this when we are trying to purchase something online, and while including our shipping details, if we were to forget our address, the page would warn us and not let us proceed until we fill in the required information.
          <br>
          <br>
          These are just 2 examples of pseudo selectors, but there are many more that can provide us with a wide range of special characteristics and allow us enhance the user experience.
